 Here‚Äôs a clean PRD artifact for **Heuristic Selector + Codex Decomposer + Codex Executor**. This keeps your stack lean, avoids overcomplicating with a tiny local model, and still gives you safety + parallelism.
 
 Important: In this PRD codex the CLI for openai could be any LLM!

# PRD: Heuristic Selector + Codex Decomposer + Codex Executor + Orchestrator

**Scope:** Codex Flow Orchestration Layer
**Owner:** Orchestration Team
**Date:** 2025-09

---

## 1. Problem

The problem with agentic systems is that they‚Äôre usually tied to a single provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.). This creates lock-in, brittle integrations, and heavy SDK dependencies.

We want a **BYOM** (‚ÄúBring Your Own Model‚Äù) orchestrator that:

* Works with *any* underlying LLM (via Codex CLI / APIs).
* Lets users run multi-agent workflows **simply** (two commands max).
* Ensures predictability, parallelism, and valid outputs.

---

## 2. Goals

* Separate orchestration into **clear, auditable stages**.
* Each stage has its own contract (input ‚Üí output).
* Guarantee schema-valid JSON at all boundaries.
* Provide clear logging: which agents were selected, why, what the plan was, and how execution ran.
* Enable **parallelism** where possible, sequential execution where needed.

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

Pipeline:

```
User ‚Üí Orchestrator ‚Üí Selector ‚Üí Decomposer ‚Üí Executor ‚Üí Orchestrator ‚Üí User
```

### Components

#### A) Orchestrator

* **What:** The central control loop. Orchestrates flow between Selector, Decomposer, and Executor. Validates outputs. Collects logs. Returns results.
* **Why:** Without this, you get ‚Äúloose scripts‚Äù that don‚Äôt connect. The Orchestrator enforces discipline: one entry point, one control plane, one logging format. It separates *process management* from *planning/execution*.

---

#### B) Heuristic Selector

* **What:** A lightweight rule-based system (keywords, regex) that picks candidate agents and suggests coordination phases. Runs instantly (<50ms).
* **Why:** Determinism. Users shouldn‚Äôt wait for an LLM just to figure out ‚Äúyou need a builder + tester.‚Äù A heuristic selector is fast, transparent, and easy to extend. It keeps the system responsive even offline.

---

#### C) Codex Decomposer (or any LLM)

* **What:** Given a goal + selected agents + coordination skeleton, the Decomposer outputs a strict JSON plan (DAG) and starting orders for each agent.
* **Why:** LLMs are excellent at breaking vague requests into steps. By isolating decomposition into this stage, we let Codex do what it‚Äôs best at (pattern expansion, ordering) while containing risk: outputs must pass schema validation.

---

#### D) Codex Executor (or any LLM)

* **What:** Executes tasks defined in the DAG. Respects `dependsOn` rules and parallelizes tasks where possible. Logs structured events (`task_start`, `task_complete`, `task_error`).
* **Why:** Execution is messy ‚Äî failures, retries, partial results. Separating it from planning ensures we don‚Äôt mix ‚Äúwhat to do‚Äù with ‚Äúhow it‚Äôs running.‚Äù Executor can evolve independently (e.g. retries, sandboxing, observability).

---

#### E) Validation + Observability Layer

* **What:** JSON schema validators + logs for each boundary.
* **Why:** LLMs are probabilistic. We need a deterministic guardrail between stages. Validation ensures downstream components never receive malformed data. Observability gives users confidence that orchestration is doing the right thing.

## 4. Deliverables

1. **Orchestrator CLI/API**

   * Single entry point.
   * Commands: `bootstrap`, `swarm "<goal>"`.
   * Wraps Selector ‚Üí Decomposer ‚Üí Executor.

2. **Selector**

   * Ruleset:

     * ‚Äúbuild/create/implement‚Äù ‚Üí builder
     * ‚Äútest/validate/check‚Äù ‚Üí tester
     * ‚Äúanalyze/review/document‚Äù ‚Üí reviewer
   * Always returns 2‚Äì5 agents + reasons.

3. **Decomposer (Codex)**

   * Input: `{goal, agents, coordination}`
   * Output: `{plan, orders}`
   * Rules enforced: ‚â§7 tasks, DAG acyclic, parallelizable flagged.

4. **Executor (Codex)**

   * Input: `{plan, orders}`
   * Runs tasks with DAG awareness.
   * Logs progress to console + JSONL.

5. **Validation Layer**

   * JSON Schema enforced at Selector ‚Üí Decomposer, Decomposer ‚Üí Executor.
   * Automatic retry if schema invalid.

6. **Observability**

   * Console summary:

     ```
     üß© Agents selected: builder, tester, reviewer
     üìë Coordination: Design ‚Üí Scaffold ‚Üí Implement/Test ‚Üí Review
     üìÇ DAG: 5 tasks, 2 parallelizable
     ‚úÖ Run complete
     ```
   * Persisted logs: `selector.jsonl`, `decomposer.jsonl`, `executor.jsonl`.

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

* Orchestrator runs Selector ‚Üí Decomposer ‚Üí Executor deterministically.
* Selector always returns schema-valid agent list.
* Decomposer always returns schema-valid JSON (retry ‚â§2).
* DAG is valid (acyclic, dependencies satisfied).
* Executor honors parallelism/sequencing.
* Logs show selection, DAG, and execution clearly.

---

## 6. Testing Plan

* **Unit tests**

  * Selector keyword‚Üíagent correctness.
  * Schema validation edge cases.
  * DAG validator (detect cycles, invalid dependsOn).

* **Integration tests**

  * Full pipeline on sample goals.
  * Verify logs + artifacts.
  * Parallelism confirmed with mock agents.

* **Failure injection**

  * Decomposer returns malformed JSON ‚Üí schema retry.
  * Missing agent in plan ‚Üí fallback safe default.
  * Executor task error ‚Üí dependent tasks skipped.

---

## 7. Non-Goals

* No persistent memory across runs.
* No dynamic agent creation (future: PlannerFactory).
* No streaming/tool enforcement yet.

---

## 8. Future Work

* Add PlannerFactory (dynamic agent creation).
* Add Redis memory + context bus.
* Add structured observability (JSON logs + metrics).
* Add streaming providers for interactive runs.

---

‚úÖ With this separation, you get:

* **Selector** = fast, deterministic filter (what‚Äôs relevant).
* **Decomposer** = flexible LLM brain (how to break it down).
* **Executor** = disciplined runner (how to actually run it).
* **Orchestrator** = the conductor (keeps everything in sync).

This is simple, explainable, and model-agnostic.

Do you want me to now **sketch a visual (Mermaid DAG diagram)** of this architecture with the *What/Why* inline so you can drop it into your repo docs?
