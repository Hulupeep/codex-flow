Then, for Implementation, we can work on the frontend, backend, and documentation simultaneously. Finally, we'll have Testing & Validation, where testing and validation can also run in parallel.\\n\\nI want to map each alias to a brief description of its responsibility. For Supabase auth, I'll set up the project and configure the providers without including network steps. The SaaS specifics include defining the MVP, focusing on a simple setup.

I'll map responsibilities for each role, including the architect defining MVP scope and auth flows, the planner establishing timelines, and the frontend building landing and auth pages. \\n\\nFor the backend, I’ll work on the Supabase schema and policies, while docs cover the README and setup instructions.

In the documentation, I'll write product copy and usage instructions. \\n\\nNow for the \\\"QA & Launch\\\" phase, I'll keep tasks running simultaneously for testers, validators, and docs.
