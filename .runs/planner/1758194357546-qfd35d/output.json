For the phases, I think I should start with Phase 1: Discover & Architecture, which will be parallelized. The tasks for each alias include:\\n\\nFor the architect: define the domain model and design service boundaries. For the planner: define MVP scope and establish milestones and success metrics. The frontend will draft wireframes and choose component libraries, while the backend drafts API endpoints and data schema. Documentation should include the vision and necessary templates.\\n\\nPhase 2 is MVP Build, also parallel.

I’ll implement user accounts with JWT or session authentication, set up CRUD endpoints, handle database migrations, and include a basic billing stub for Stripe in test mode since it's a SaaS app.\\n\\nDocumentation needs updates, like a README and API reference. For testing, I’ll focus on unit tests and API contract tests, while validators will work on user walkthrough scripts and feedback collection.\\n\\nFor Phase 3, the plan is to test, polish, and launch. Tasks will involve a performance review, UI polishing, hardening authentication, and conducting end-to-end smoke tests.
